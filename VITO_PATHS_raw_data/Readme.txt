TIMES scenario: Alignment meeting between PATH2050 and ecoinvent 3.8.

EEUCBIOSTEL0: Biomass power plant
--> Technology is still unclear. There is no general dataset for biomass, so it should be more specific.
--> Daniele wanted to have a look in the ecoinvent db for a matching dataset

xxxCHP-x-ST-*HEA-01: Steam CHP (mostly electricity and some residual heat) Existing
--> The technologies ending with 00 are the 'reference technologies currently in place.
--> The above technologies are the same as the reference technologies, but with improved efficiencies.
--> In this case: both are coal CHP, hence the corresponding dataset is 'heat and power co-generation, hard coal'.

NRESMIXSTEL0: Electricity utility : aggregated small installations
--> A combination of various small biomass power plants.
--> Mixture of waste that is processed, which makes it different to Municipal Solid Waste (confirmed by Juan)

Imports:
--> No data on which country the imports comes from, but values are avialable for which technologies supply the imports
--> E.g. Production|Electricity|Neighbor countries|Coal
--> Those data are only available from 2025 onwards

Losses - two type of losses:
1. Electricity self-consumption (electricity used by the power plants)
2. Transmission and distribution losses

Fuels:
--> Data are available for fuel consumption of the energy system.
--> Efficiencies are available as well.
